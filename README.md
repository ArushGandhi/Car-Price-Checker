# Price predictor for BMW automobiles

Created a tool entirely in R that predicts the price of a new/old BMW model based on a customized mix of automotive features with a MAE of ~$3K.
Followed the structured CRISM-DM approach to implement, evaluate and compare various machine learning models 
Performed graphic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, imputation, normalization and feature engineering
Trained data using Regression Trees, k-NN, Linear Regression and SVM
Tuned the models to improve performance, evaluated each model through model ensemble learning,  k-fold cross validations and compared the accuracy based on RMSE and MAD values
